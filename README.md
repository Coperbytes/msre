## msre heat exchangers

open-access [master's thesis](https://ltu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1546993/FULLTEXT01.pdf) produced by Malcolm Akner about simulations of the heat exchangers of the msre, titled: 

> Validating results from the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment by use of turbulent CFD simulations
> A study of a modified U-tube shell-and-tube primary heat exchanger and radiator with molten salts
